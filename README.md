# atom-haskell package

Curated set of packages for Haskell development with Atom. The package list taken from [Atom-Haskell Documentation](https://atom-haskell.github.io) (not made by me :). Detailed configuration, documentation and much more can be found there.

This package installs the following for you:

-   [language-haskell](https://atom.io/packages/language-haskell) – Syntax highlighting and Haskell autodetection
-   [ide-haskell](https://atom.io/packages/ide-haskell) – GUI and minimal utilities
-   [ide-haskell-cabal](https://atom.io/packages/ide-haskell-cabal) – Build Haskell projects with either cabal or stack. Reports errors/warnings on build.
-   [haskell-ghc-mod](https://atom.io/packages/haskell-ghc-mod) – ghc-mod integration. Typecheck and lint sources without building, query type information and more.
-   [autocomplete-haskell](https://atom.io/packages/autocomplete-haskell) – Autocompletion support. This plugin depends on haskell-ghc-mod.
-   [haskell-pointfree](https://atom.io/packages/haskell-pointfree) – convert selection to pointfree/pointful representation
-   [ide-haskell-hasktags](https://atom.io/packages/ide-haskell-hasktags) – go to declaration, list all symbols defined in file/project
-   [ide-haskell-hoogle](https://atom.io/packages/ide-haskell-hoogle) – lookup hoogle documentation via local hoogle database
-   [ide-haskell-repl](https://atom.io/packages/ide-haskell-repl) – GHCi REPL in Atom
-   [language-haskell-scoped](https://atom.io/packages/language-haskell-scoped) – highlight known identifiers in editor
-   [haskell-scry](https://atom.io/packages/haskell-scry) - de-emphasizes qualified Haskell identifiers

Additionally it installs,

-   [atom-hasklig](https://atom.io/packages/hasklig) throws in the nice Hasklig font
-   [atom-beautify](https://atom.io/packages/atom-beautify) use this to beautify instead of `ide-haskell`, to avoid annoying red error boxes when you save a file with a syntax error (this can also beautify a plethora of other languages)
-   [linter](https://atom.io/packages/linter) for prettier `hlint`/`ghc-mod` output
-   [linter-ui-default](https://atom.io/packages/linter-ui-default) which brings some UI additions for the linter
-   [language-yaml](https://atom.io/packages/language-yaml) for all those `stack.yaml`s

any of which you can disable. If you don't like the way `atom-hasklig` alters
fonts, uninstall it and clear the `Font Family` box in Settings (Preferences),
under `Editor`.

# Quick configuration

You will be prompted if you want to set some nice default configuration values for the installed packages. You will only be asked once, and you can dismiss this and later run it manually via the Command Palette and then `Atom Haskell: Set Default Configuration`.

# Binaries

To set up the binaries (except formatters) for the above you can run,

```bash
stack install ghc-mod hoogle hasktags pointfree pointful cabal-install
```

For formatters you have some choice between `stylish-haskell`, `hindent` and `brittany`, whichever you prefer. E.g.,

```bash
stack install hindent
```

Follow this up with:  
Edit -> Preferences -> Packages -> atom-beautify -> Settings -> Haskell ->
*expand* -> *[your choice of beautifier]*

# Other things

## Spacemacs-esque keybindings

A bit of a self-plug, but you might also like my keybindings package [spaceatom-keybindings](https://github.com/Tehnix/spaceatom-keybindings), if you're coming from spacemacs and still have that muscle memory.

## Spacemacs dark theme

I also recommend the theme [Spacemacs Dark](https://github.com/Tehnix/spacemacsdark-syntax-atom), where I added some additional highlighting for Haskell. It is, as the name implies, inspired by the Spacemacs dark theme.
